# Parcel-Tsx-Template

English | [ç®€ä½“ä¸­æ–‡](README-zh-CN.md)

## What's inside?ðŸ¤”

This is a simple template which help you to start a project quickly with [Parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel), which includes tool below:

- Typescript(4.0.2)
- React(16.13.1)
- Jest(25.1.0) & Enzyme(3.11.0)
- @Ice/spec(eslint & prettier config support)
- Less(3.10.3)

I skip some configuration and toolkit/framework/solution to make it can be customized and configurable for most people. Like you can choose `Styled-Components` + `React-Redux` or `CSS Modules` + `Dva`, just do it you like.

## Too Simple?ðŸ¤ 

Besides, if you need a more complete template, maybe you will like this: [Webpack4.x-Template](https://github.com/linbudu599/Webpack4.x-Template)(there is only **Simplified Chinese** version).
